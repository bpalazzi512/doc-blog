One of the first things that I learned was that Belgium, similar to other European countries, still technically has royalty. Belgium specifically has a king, who mainly serves as a strong symbol of the country. He acts as a voice that citizens and government officials can trust and respect regarding major events or policies. In addition, The king still has some political power, like advising on country policy, even though Belgium is now a parliamentary democracy. One of the things that I found most interesting about the king is that he is still technically the head of the armed forces, though it is assumed that if Belgium were to ever get involved in a major conflict the troops would come under the command of NATO. I also learned how Belgium is split up into communities and regions, each with their own political powers. Communities are solely language based, split between Dutch, French, and German. Each community in Belgium has jurisdiction over language, education, and culture among other things. Regions, on the other hand, have significant jurisdiction and act as the main form of governance. They control areas like the economy, public transportation, housing, and energy. There are three regions in Belgium, the Flemish, Wallon, and Brussels Capital region. There is a lot of overlap between the communities and regions with a few caveats, like the Walloon region which comprises both the French-speaking and German-speaking communities. These regions also have a significant effect on the representation they get in the federal parliament. While in the US seats in the House of Representatives are proportional to the population of each state, Belgiumâ€™s parliament seats (Senate and Chamber of Representatives) are proportional to the number of speakers for each language.\n","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/bobbypalazzi/phase1/","section":"My Posts","summary":"Government and Politics in Belgium!","title":"Phase 1 Individual Post","type":"bobbypalazzi"},{"content":" Welcome to Team Keefe # This is a really cool blog\n","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/team_posts/","section":"Project - Phase I","summary":"Welcome to Team Keefe # This is a really cool blog","title":"Project - Phase I","type":"team_posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/authors/seamus_coyne/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Seamus_coyne","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/bradyli/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"bradyli"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/gavinsanders/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"gavinsanders"},{"content":" Blog Post 1 # So far I\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed Belgium and the programme. I love how every town we visit has its own unique charm and character; Leuven in particular has been a pleasure to stay in. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the standard of life here vs. in the US. I think there\u0026rsquo;s definitely a lot of lessons we could learn from the Belgians and from Europe in general. For one: college only costs $900 per year. It would be great if we could get on top of that one fast, say within the next 3 years. The dependance on bikes has also been eye-opening here. I think the US should definitely be taking more steps to encourage biking, perhaps by diverting highway funds into bike infrastructure. Though I doubt we\u0026rsquo;ll ever reach Belgium\u0026rsquo;s level of bike-usage, we can definitely improve our numbers. (Pictured below: a sea of bikes I saw in Ghent).\nThe guest speakers have also been great (except for the odd one or two). I\u0026rsquo;m very interested in foreign policy / international relations so it was cool to hear from people working in this field. In particular, I enjoyed the ones about combatting disinformation and imposing sanctions post-Russian-invasion. I\u0026rsquo;ve been impressed with some of the questions our group has asked and (to my own surprise) was even compelled to ask one or two myself. (Pictured below: an ilegal picture I snuck from outside NATO)\nMy favorite day trip that we\u0026rsquo;ve done so far has been Namur. I feel like my group really maximized our 2 hours there. We took the cable car up to the citadel before eventually meeting up with the others to go to the NAM-IP Computer Musuem. I found the musuem really interesting. As weird as it sounds, there was something \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo; about the old punch-card machines. I found myself wondering \u0026ldquo;how can a purely mechanical machine do that?\u0026rdquo;. If someone from the 70s saw the phone in my pocket, they would likely be asking themselves the opposite question. (Pictured below: computer, obviously)\nAlso Bruges was really cool and definitely a higlight.\n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/gavinsanders/blog1/","section":"","summary":"Blog Post 1 # So far I\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed Belgium and the programme.","title":"","type":"gavinsanders"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/seamuscoyne/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"seamuscoyne"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
