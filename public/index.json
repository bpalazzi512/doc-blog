It still feels very surreal being in Europe. The dialogue has been pretty great so far. Leuven and Belgium seem to be a great place to study abroad, it feels like a very perfect picturesque European town and easy access to places and food. The food is really nice here, with a surprising amount of asian food, which I desperately needed after the burgers and fries. I’m really surprised with the cost of food here; it is oddly a lot cheaper than Boston. Where is the water? It costs 3 euros for water but 4 euros for a KFC combo meal. The water at ICL is really nice though. I like how ICL is an old building but also really nice.\nThe STUDY in study abroad is hitting. It felt like a lot of stuff was thrown at us the first few lectures but the homework and the last lecture 5/20 really helped clear some things up. Lecture and learning databases has allowed me a glimpse into how some applications like Instagram and Google manage their data. Creating tables with all the attributes reminds me of creating classes and fields in Java, as well as the hard work required to reference and access data from different tables.\nWe had a very eventful first week visiting the Computer Science museum, European External Action Service (EEAS), NATO, and talking with the Institute for Economics and Peace. The dialogue group asked some great questions and I think we did a very good job in keeping the conversations going as a group. I’m glad I got to ask some questions. The person’s response to my question at EEAS felt like they refrained from saying too much. I feel like a lot of the speakers are tippy-toed around current conflicts. I should try and keep pushing for answers and include more of the ongoing topics in the future. Visiting NATO HQ felt very surreal. I had a great conversation with some of the people over dinner and It makes me really appreciate being able to study these topics abroad!\nThe free day on sunday 5/19 was great! We went to Bruges, Ghent, and Blankenberge. The sites were really beautiful, European architecture and cities are so nice. I’m so thankful to be studying in a place in Europe where it is not that touristy. It allows me to immerse myself fully.\n","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/bradyli/blp1/","section":"My Posts","summary":"This is my first post!","title":"Brady's post #1","type":"bradyli"},{"content":"","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/tags/config/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Config","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/tags/docs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Docs","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/authors/gavin_sanders/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Gavin_sanders","type":"authors"},{"content":" Welcome to my blog # ","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/bradyli/","section":"My Posts","summary":" Welcome to my blog # ","title":"My Posts","type":"bradyli"},{"content":" Welcome to my blog # ","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/gavinsanders/","section":"My Posts","summary":" Welcome to my blog # ","title":"My Posts","type":"gavinsanders"},{"content":" Introduction # Hi, We are Team Gerbies!\n","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/team_posts/phase1post/","section":"Project - Phase I","summary":"Introduction # Hi, We are Team Gerbies!","title":"Project - Phase I","type":"team_posts"},{"content":"","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/authors/seamus_coyne/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Seamus_coyne","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/","section":"Summer 2024 Brussels DoC Blog (The Gerbies)","summary":"","title":"Summer 2024 Brussels DoC Blog (The Gerbies)","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Welcome to my blog # ","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/bobbypalazzi/","section":"My Posts","summary":" Welcome to my blog # ","title":"My Posts","type":"bobbypalazzi"},{"content":" Government and Politics in Belgium!! # Something interesting that I learned is how a few parts of the government of Belgium are structured while I was completing the first lab for DS3000, when I had to make a section in markdown describing anything relating to government and/or politics. One of the first things that I learned was that Belgium, similar to other European countries, still technically has royalty. Belgium specifically has a king, who mainly serves as a strong symbol of the country. He acts as a voice that citizens and government officials can trust and respect regarding major events or policies. In addition, The king still has some political power, like advising on country policy, even though Belgium is now a parliamentary democracy. One of the things that I found most interesting about the king is that he is still technically the head of the armed forces, though it is assumed that if Belgium were to ever get involved in a major conflict the troops would come under the command of NATO. I also learned how Belgium is split up into communities and regions, each with their own political powers. Communities are solely language based, split between Dutch, French, and German. Each community in Belgium has jurisdiction over language, education, and culture among other things. Regions, on the other hand, have significant jurisdiction and act as the main form of governance. They control areas like the economy, public transportation, housing, and energy. There are three regions in Belgium, the Flemish, Wallon, and Brussels Capital region. There is a lot of overlap between the communities and regions with a few caveats, like the Walloon region which comprises both the French-speaking and German-speaking communities. These regions also have a significant effect on the representation they get in the federal parliament. While in the US seats in the House of Representatives are proportional to the population of each state, Belgium’s parliament seats (Senate and Chamber of Representatives) are proportional to the number of speakers for each language.\n","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/bobbypalazzi/phase1/","section":"My Posts","summary":"Government and Politics in Belgium!","title":"Phase 1 Individual Post","type":"bobbypalazzi"},{"content":" Welcome to Team Keefe # This is a really cool blog\n","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/team_posts/","section":"Project - Phase I","summary":"Welcome to Team Keefe # This is a really cool blog","title":"Project - Phase I","type":"team_posts"},{"content":" Blog Post 1 # So far I\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed Belgium and the programme. I love how every town we visit has its own unique charm and character; Leuven in particular has been a pleasure to stay in. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the standard of life here vs. in the US. I think there\u0026rsquo;s definitely a lot of lessons we could learn from the Belgians and from Europe in general. For one: college only costs $900 per year. It would be great if we could get on top of that one fast, say within the next 3 years. The dependance on bikes has also been eye-opening here. I think the US should definitely be taking more steps to encourage biking, perhaps by diverting highway funds into bike infrastructure. Though I doubt we\u0026rsquo;ll ever reach Belgium\u0026rsquo;s level of bike-usage, we can definitely improve our numbers. (Pictured below: a sea of bikes I saw in Ghent).\nThe guest speakers have also been great (except for the odd one or two). I\u0026rsquo;m very interested in foreign policy / international relations so it was cool to hear from people working in this field. In particular, I enjoyed the ones about combatting disinformation and imposing sanctions post-Russian-invasion. I\u0026rsquo;ve been impressed with some of the questions our group has asked and (to my own surprise) was even compelled to ask one or two myself. (Pictured below: an ilegal picture I snuck from outside NATO)\nMy favorite day trip that we\u0026rsquo;ve done so far has been Namur. I feel like my group really maximized our 2 hours there. We took the cable car up to the citadel before eventually meeting up with the others to go to the NAM-IP Computer Musuem. I found the musuem really interesting. As weird as it sounds, there was something \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo; about the old punch-card machines. I found myself wondering \u0026ldquo;how can a purely mechanical machine do that?\u0026rdquo;. If someone from the 70s saw the phone in my pocket, they would likely be asking themselves the opposite question. (Pictured below: computer, obviously)\nAlso Bruges was really cool and definitely a higlight.\n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/gavinsanders/blog1/","section":"My Posts","summary":"Blog Post 1 # So far I\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed Belgium and the programme.","title":"","type":"gavinsanders"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/seamuscoyne/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"seamuscoyne"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/seamuscoyne/blog1/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"seamuscoyne"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/doc-blog/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
