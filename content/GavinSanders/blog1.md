# Blog Post 1

So far I've really enjoyed Belgium and the programme. I love how every town we visit has its own unique charm and character; Leuven in particular has been a pleasure to stay in. I've been thinking a lot about the standard of life here vs. in the US. I think there's definitely a lot of lessons we could learn from the Belgians and from Europe in general. For one: college only costs $900 per year. It would be great if we could get on top of that one fast, say within the next 3 years. The dependance on bikes has also been eye-opening here. I think the US should definitely be taking more steps to encourage biking, perhaps by diverting highway funds into bike infrastructure. Though I doubt we'll ever reach Belgium's level of bike-usage, we can definitely improve our numbers. (Pictured below: a sea of bikes I saw in Ghent).

The guest speakers have also been great (except for the odd one or two). I'm very interested in foreign policy / international relations so it was cool to hear from people working in this field. In particular, I enjoyed the ones about combatting  disinformation and imposing sanctions post-Russian-invasion.  I've been impressed with some of the questions our group has asked and (to my own surprise) was even compelled to ask one or two myself. (Pictured below: an **ilegal** picture I snuck from outside NATO)

My favorite day trip that we've done so far has been Namur. I feel like my group really maximized our 2 hours there. We took the cable car up to the citadel before eventually meeting up with the others to go to the NAM-IP Computer Musuem. I found the musuem really interesting. As weird as it sounds, there was something "magical" about the old punch-card machines. I found myself wondering "how can a purely mechanical machine do that?". If someone from the 70s saw the phone in my pocket, they would likely be asking themselves the opposite question. (Pictured below: computer, obviously)

Also Bruges was really cool and definitely a higlight.
