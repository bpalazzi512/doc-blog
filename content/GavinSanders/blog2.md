## Personal Update:

It's weird to me that we're already halfway through the Dialogue. On one hand, it feels like it's gone by so quickly, but on the other, it feels like it was forever ago that I was waiting in customs at Zaventem airport. I've continued to really enjoy my time here. Some highlights since the last blog post have been the visit to the Atomium, the visit to Microsoft, and of course the amazing pastry lesson courtesy of Dr. Fontenot!

## Project Contribution:
Though I was initially very stressed about this week's deliverables, I'm ultimately very pleased with what our team was able to accomplish. Going into Phase II, we had many issues with our core idea. As addressed in the team blog post, this had to do largely with the user stories being too similar. Brady and I spent a long time discussing alternatives before we settled on the "moving company" and "country admin" archetypes. I'm happy with these additions as I feel like they each add a lot of new useful features to our app. I also worked on the ERD diagrams with Brady. We worked together on these using Excalidraw, and had many constructuve discussions on how to best structure the data. Though we began by working on the Exacalidraw ERDs together, it transitioned to us working in parallel, with me now doing the SQL schema. I also did the wireframe sketches for our group, which included the main landing page of the site where the countries are ranked, a conutry-specific landing page, and the portal for a moving company to edit their data. Brady and I looked at a real international movers' website for inspiration. On an unrelated note, Brady has been called by 10 moving companies today since he made an account on this site. Finally, I was responsible for writing the CS component of the group blog post this week and putting all of our links / images together.
