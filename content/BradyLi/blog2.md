## Learning / Project
We are more than halfway through the dialouge! The quiz on SQL was challenging in a good way; it made me think critically and work my way around the problem throughout the exam. Over the week we learned how to make a database and how to start planning out the outline of the project. The ER diagrams and learning to break down a large-scale problem into parts have been very eye-opening. It is a nice change from Fundies Two with the step-by-step instructions for a simple game. It makes me want to do personal projects and make a start-up.

Gavin and I wrote the phase 1 blog post and cleaned up our idea. I found the EuroStat API for the dataset. I drafted the ER diagrams with Gavin and drew them up after discussing them with Dr. Fontenot and Gavin. I helped flesh out the idea with the overall application and design with the rest of the team. I helped create new Personas and user stories and explained the changes we made with the DS side.

## Guest Speakers
There were some really cool visits this week! The KU Leuven speakers were really engaging and it was interesting to learn more about the EU. I enjoyed the conversation about AI with Dr. Joep Crompvoets it felt like he was the most technical person we got so far. Over the week we got to visit the EU parliament, and the Commission, the EU Cybersecurity Organization! The locations of the EU bodies were cool; however, the speakers felt very surface-level. The presentation and conversations could have been more productive because the people were not technical and spoke very broadly about AI policy. I wish we had more technical and professor speakers. I was expecting an engineer or data scientist with Microsoft or the EU Cybersecurity Organization. However, the closest we got was an AI slide or a cybersecurity policy speaker. 

## Excursions 
The Atomium visit was so cool! It was nice that I went in knowing nothing. The light/music room was mesmerizing; I could have stayed there for hours. I had some great food this week, there are so many good Asian places. The professors treated us to dinner quite a few times, and a lot of us feel guilty for doing so. Grateful that they are the professors I am in the dialouge with.

**Sunday was a fun day :D**

We made pastries at Nihoul in Brussels with Dr. Fontenot's friend! It was one of the coolest and most enjoyable parts of the dialouge thus far. Everyone was laughing and having a good time. It is very funny and interesting seeing the professors act like everyday people. Dr. Gerber was talking with a surfer accent. I am very thankful to have this group in the dialouge.
