# LAST DAY! 
The last few days have been a blur with project work. The amount of work and refinement we did from phases two and three to the final product we will present in a few hours is insane! I am so proud of the team for putting everything together and making such a well-polished final product! 

# Thoughts
It was a bit sad being overwhelmed with so much project work and speakers the last week. I enjoyed the mine visit, the tour guide was funny. The stairs up the tower in the mines were not for the weak, it was a struggle. There were some things I did not get to do on my list like watch a European soccer game like my brother told me to do; I had to give away my ticket to grind on more features. I wanted to go biking but didn’t get to it. I am so grateful to the professors for helping late into the night! Although I didn’t get to do more Leuven things, I will look back fondly to the nights in Europe trying to code as fast as possible and running into a stupid syntax quote error. Who at Northeastern can say they were coding late into the night abroad!?

# Work
I made probably most of the API routes so like 25 to 30. I left the other members to fix and work on integrating the ML and country rankings. Meanwhile, I worked the most on linking everything with the backend and database. I ensured the frontend displays were not just for show and that every button press, whether it was a save, edit, delete, select, or switch; all had an after-effect. All of the moving companies' personas features I built. This included displaying, editing, deleting, and posting to the database in a clean format. It was linked to other buttons and features on the country page where moving companies were also displayed and contactable by a button. Frontend wise I redid the home page, designed the moving company pages, and added some features to the country pages. 

# Struggle 
It was a struggle to get everything working. Every new route and feature would come with errors sometimes as small as a comma. We struggled with the PUT requests at the start, but once we got one of each our only enemy was time. I could envision how implementations for features could go it just meant I would have to debug because I knew bugs were bound to pop up. I learned so much about how to build software. I can see why people say software engineers spend their entire day just working on a single button now! It was so much work, but it made me realize that I enjoy CS and software development; I was dreaming of code and was excited in the morning to implement more and more features. I got so much better with debugging and man GPT is such a good tool to help debug.

# Resume points!
This is could be better, will expand on it and reword more after project end date:

- A functioning website application to help individuals thinking about moving abroad supporting users, moving companies, and admins.
- Developed and implemented a database and Flask rest API contianing 40 routes to the frontend made using streamlit and python.
- Incorportated backend to frontend to update seamlessly.

# Going to miss this dialouge!
This has been an amazing experience, amazing people, amazing professors, amazing work! So sad it is all over, but I will stay connected with everyone!
