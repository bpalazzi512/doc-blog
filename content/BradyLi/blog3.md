# Blog :D
Luxembourg was fun I should have locked myself in the hotel because phase 3 has been a lot of work. I did not expect to be coding at 4:00 in the morning but we got there :D. I helped organize the project repo and integrated the pages from the template working with pages to help get us started. I configured the settings and changed some strings so that they suited our project. From there, we started creating our own pages and routes. I created the backend rest API with over 10 routes with each one of each route. We ran into a lot of trouble when testing the routes and we only fixed it with Dr. Fontenot near midnight. I helped create additional pages and abstract the country page to one page by using routes to get attributes of a country when clicked. I worked on integrating the restAPI into our front end with buttons, inputs, and GETs. I started to integrate the machine learning model into the project. I worked on linking the frontend with the backend and database for moving companies, country pages, and passing around the user data through routes.

Reflecting back though, I have learned so much! I want to start doing some ER diagrams on a personal project I have been meaning to start. I hope the professors can help with that back in Bosotn.

# Speakers
I enjoyed the EuroStat visit it was really nice hearing the staticians speak on relevant topics. I can't sit through another presentation with buzz words like AI, AI act, Blockchain, Big Data. The health house was interesting...

I'm tired. I'm ready for this to be over.
