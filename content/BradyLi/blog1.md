It has been a week in Belgium already! It still feels very surreal being in Europe. The dialogue has been pretty great so far. Leuven and Belgium seem to be a great place to study abroad, it feels like a very perfect picturesque European town and easy access to places and food. The food is really nice here, with a surprising amount of asian food, which I desperately needed after the burgers and fries. I’m really surprised with the cost of food here; it is oddly a lot cheaper than Boston. Where is the water? It costs 3 euros for water but 4 euros for a KFC combo meal. The water at ICL is really nice though. I like how ICL is an old building but also really nice.

The STUDY in study abroad is hitting. It felt like a lot of stuff was thrown at us the first few lectures but the homework and the last lecture 5/20 really helped clear some things up. Lecture and learning databases has allowed me a glimpse into how some applications like Instagram and Google manage their data. Creating tables with all the attributes reminds me of creating classes and fields in Java, as well as the hard work required to reference and access data from different tables.

We had a very eventful first week visiting the Computer Science museum, European External Action Service (EEAS), NATO, and talking with the Institute for Economics and Peace. The dialogue group asked some great questions and I think we did a very good job in keeping the conversations going as a group. I’m glad I got to ask some questions. The person’s response to my question at EEAS felt like they refrained from saying too much. I feel like a lot of the speakers are tippy-toed around current conflicts. I should try and keep pushing for answers and include more of the ongoing topics in the future. Visiting NATO HQ felt very surreal. I had a great conversation with some of the people over dinner and It makes me really appreciate being able to study these topics abroad!

The free day on sunday 5/19 was great! We went to Bruges, Ghent, and Blankenberge. The sites were really beautiful, European architecture and cities are so nice. I’m so thankful to be studying in a place in Europe where it is not that touristy. It allows me to immerse myself fully.
