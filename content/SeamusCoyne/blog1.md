# First post!!!!!!


One week in Belgium is complete! I admit that the Google photos of Leuven made me a bit skeptical, but I have quickly come to love the town, as well as Belgium as a whole. The environment, food, and culture are all still interesting, and I've quickly come to appreciate the relative affordability of Leuven compared to Boston. As I learn more about the region, there are some difference between European and American life that stick out. Easily the most surreal is the presence of bikes everywhere. In Boston, the threat of getting hit by a rogue car is far greater than by one of the few bikers on the roads - here, it is quite the opposite. I was also surprised to discover the diversity around Belgium, particularly between people and food. While America prides itself on being a melting pot of different cultures, this is clearly very true elsewhere as well.

Recently, the academic component of the program has become increasingly time consuming. Coupled with the guest speakers and visits, I'm quickly starting to bridge my gap in understanding between the worlds of international affairs and technology. Some talks that were particularly interesting to me were at the NATO Headquarters, particularly with the contrast between some of the speakers' focus on policy and others' focus on technology. Despite not being something I frequently think about, learning about the sanctions imposed against Russia in an effort to limit the country's reach was fascinating.

So far, my favorite day trip has been to Namur, where we had to opportunity to tour the Nam IP Computer Museum. I enjoyed having time to experience the city and move throughout the open-air markets and citadel during some of our freetime. While at Nam IP, it was interesting to learn more about the fundamental background of computing through history. For me, it is easy to forget the amount of work that allowed me to use the computers I use on a daily basis, so seeing the layout from most basic to modern computers was interesting.
