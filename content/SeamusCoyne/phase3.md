During this stage of the project, I primarily focused on sourcing additional data and mapping out the future of the larger scale model. The team was satisfied with the results of the initial linear regression produced during Phase 2, and thus felt no need to revise it moving forward. Because of this, the next steps prioritized ensuring and optimal user experience with the best output possible. To do this, new sources of data cover additional topics, such as public education/schools and climate, had to be sourced. Bobby and I divided this aspect of work, sourcing, processing, and cleaning new files to ensure consistent data that could be transfered to the database with relative ease.

Looking forward, it was important for us to consider the next model that would be developed. Throughout the project, we had discussed a handful of approaches to generated the 'match' countries for users, ranging from advanced neural networks to much more basic multiple regressions. Ultimately, we set our sights between K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors models. Both forms require similar data cleaning methodology and setup. Because of this, we felt relatively comfortable delaying a final decision until more research had been completed. I spent a significant portion of the work week reading up on these models, trying to figure out which would be preferable. And, while I can't say for sure, KNN looks very promising.

Outside of the academic program, I am continuing to love my time in Belgium. Between having more chances to explore Leuven and Brussels, as well as travel to Luxembourg, I've been having a great time. In particular, I've enjoyed the mix between social and quiet spaces in Leuven. When I want a break, I'm able to step away in a park or coffee shop, but when I feel like being around people I have ample opportunities. I'm excited to see what the last week in Belgium holds!
