# Government and Politics in Belgium!!

Something interesting that I learned is how a few parts of the government of Belgium are structured while I was completing the first lab for DS3000, when I had to make a section in markdown describing anything relating to government and/or politics. One of the first things that I learned was that Belgium, similar to other European countries, still technically has royalty. Belgium specifically has a king, who mainly serves as a strong symbol of the country. He acts as a voice that citizens and government officials can trust and respect regarding major events or policies. In addition, The king still has some political power, like advising on country policy, even though Belgium is now a parliamentary democracy. One of the things that I found most interesting about the king is that he is still technically the head of the armed forces, though it is assumed that if Belgium were to ever get involved in a major conflict the troops would come under the command of NATO.

I also learned how Belgium is split up into communities and regions, each with their own political powers. Communities are solely language based, split between Dutch, French, and German. Each community in Belgium has jurisdiction over language, education, and culture among other things. Regions, on the other hand, have significant jurisdiction and act as the main form of governance. They control areas like the economy, public transportation, housing, and energy. There are three regions in Belgium, the Flemish, Wallon, and Brussels Capital region. There is a lot of overlap between the communities and regions with a few caveats, like the Walloon region which comprises both the French-speaking and German-speaking communities.

These regions also have a significant effect on the representation they get in the federal parliament. While in the US seats in the House of Representatives are proportional to the population of each state, Belgiumâ€™s parliament seats (Senate and Chamber of Representatives) are proportional to the number of speakers for each language.
